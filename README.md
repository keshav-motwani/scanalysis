Multi-Sample Visualization and Immune Repertoire Analysis Utilities for
Single-Cell Data

## Features

scanalysis is a framework with easy-to-use yet flexible utilities for
the analysis of single-cell data. There are currently four major
emphases in scanalysis:

  - ease of analyzing multiple samples at once
  - ability to quickly generate exploratory analysis figures that are
    also publication-quality
  - immune repertoire analysis
  - preprocessing visualizations

It does not aim to replicate any functionality from popular analysis
frameworks like [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/),
[scran](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/scran.html),
[scater](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/scater.html)
or the limitless other packages available, but rather aims to fill gaps
in the current software options and is meant to be used in conjunction
with these and hopefully speed up the exploratory analysis process.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("keshavmot2/scanalysis")
```
